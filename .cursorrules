IMPORTANT: To run tests, **always** run the following command. This command takes a long time to return. Wait at least 5 minutes.
askds --system-prompt="./prompts/fix-tests.txt" cargo test

WAIT A LONG TIME FOR askds to run the tests and find the issues.

Use the output of the command to fix the tests.

IMPORTANT: Before committing, run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` and `askds --system-prompt="./prompts/fix-tests.txt" cargo test` to ensure code is formatted and linted correctly.

IMPORTANT: Never commit without running the tests.
