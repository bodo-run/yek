We should remove the notion of "chunks" from the codebase. yek will always output a single file.

Implement the changes needed to remove the chunk code.
Update docs and tests to reflect the new behavior.

We have done some work but some references are still in the codebase that mention "chunks".

You will be asked to do "Fixes" but we are really just adding a new feature.

Add ALL the files needed to implement the feature.
