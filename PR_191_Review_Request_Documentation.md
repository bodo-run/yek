**PR Title:** test: Improve test coverage to 81.36% with comprehensive edge case testing
**PR URL:** https://github.com/bodo-run/yek/pull/191

## Current Review Status

### 1. Greptile AI Review (Already Completed)
- **Review Date:** 17 hours ago from current time
- **Status:** ✅ Reviewed
- **Confidence Score:** 1/5 (Low confidence due to syntax errors)

#### Greptile AI Summary:
The PR significantly enhances the test suite for the `yek` repository by adding over 50 new unit and integration tests across all modules to achieve 79.58% code coverage. The changes are comprehensive, targeting previously untested code paths, error handling scenarios, and edge cases.

#### Files Reviewed by Greptile:
1. `tests/tree_test.rs` - 4 tests for tree generation edge cases
2. `tests/main_test.rs` - Integration tests for CLI functionality
3. `tests/priority_test.rs` - Priority handling tests with syntax errors
4. `tests/parallel_test.rs` - 5 tests for parallel file processing
5. `tests/config_test.rs` - Comprehensive configuration tests
6. `tests/lib_test.rs` - 6 tests for core library functions

#### Critical Issues Identified by Greptile:
- **SYNTAX ERRORS** in `tests/main_test.rs` and `tests/priority_test.rs` requiring immediate attention
- These errors will prevent compilation and must be fixed before merge

## Request for Thorough Code Review - Focus Areas

Please provide a comprehensive review of this PR with specific attention to the following areas:

### 1. Test Quality Assessment
- Are the test cases well-structured and maintainable?
- Do test names clearly describe what is being tested?
- Is the test organization logical and easy to navigate?

### 2. Coverage Gap Analysis
- Are there any critical code paths still missing test coverage?
- Which error handling scenarios might not be adequately tested?
- Are there any untested edge cases in the core functionality?

### 3. Edge Case Evaluation
- Are boundary conditions properly tested (empty inputs, maximum values, special characters)?
- Is Unicode and special character handling adequately covered?
- Are concurrent operation edge cases sufficiently tested?

### 4. Test Maintainability
- Are the tests using appropriate mocking strategies?
- Is there unnecessary test duplication that could be refactored?
- Are the assertions specific and meaningful?

### 5. Missing Test Scenarios
Please identify any missing test scenarios for:
- Configuration validation and merging logic
- Parallel processing boundary conditions
- Tree generation with complex file structures
- Priority handling with conflicting rules
- Error recovery and graceful degradation

### 6. Specific File Review
Please pay special attention to:
- `tests/main_test.rs` - Previously had syntax errors, verify they're fully resolved
- `tests/priority_test.rs` - Had syntax errors, confirm compilation and logic
- `tests/config_test.rs` - Review configuration edge cases
- `tests/parallel_test.rs` - Assess concurrent operation testing

### Additional Context
This PR increases coverage from 80.55% to 81.36%. While the coverage improvement is good, we want to ensure the quality of tests matches the quantity and that they provide meaningful validation of the codebase.
